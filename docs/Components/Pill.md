# Pill
The pill component represents a matcher pill that is shown in the [PillContainer](docs/Components/PillContainer.md). 

Pills will show their display component unless selected, when they will show their edit component. The display and edit components largely depend on the type property of the field, but custom components can be used if specified on the field.
