# SmartFilterAgGrid
This is the another toplevel component. The SmartFilterAgGrid wraps the SmartFilter and adds functionality to automatically configure the SmartFilter based on the AgGrid fields. It also reacts to matcher chnages to construct an automatic filter than can be used to filter AgGrid.
